#Digital Design

Repository for the course Digital Design given at Chalmers University of
Technology. The, somewhat out of order, laborations results in a RISC CPU
written in VHDL by me and my fellow classmate Robert Gustafsson.

## Note that I am all in favor of sharing ##
but if you copy this repo (or any of its content) for your own use in class, you are most likely cheating.
